# Executive Summary

In files containing CMIP model-simulation output, global attributes are used to
describe the source of the data, the imposed experiment conditions, the
contents of the file, licensing restrictions, and other information useful to
those analyzing the data.  Here we define the global attributes that should
appear in CMIP6 files (some are required, others optional), along with the
so-called CMIP6 “data reference syntax” (DRS).   The subset of global
attributes that defines the DRS is used in constructing the directory structure
and file names found in the CMIP6 archive, and also to construct URL’s leading
to further information about the simulations and in populating search facets.
