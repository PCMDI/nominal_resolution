# Abstract

There are various ways grid resolution might be defined, but in CMIP6 this
should be done in the same way by all models.  If the following procedure seems
inappropriate for a model, the modeling group may request an exception from the
WGCM Infrastructure Panel (WIP).  In general, the nominal resolution
characterizes the resolution of the grid used to report model output fields,
which may differ from the native grid on which the fields are calculated by the
model.
